# My Hyprland Dotfiles

This is my personal [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) dotfiles.

## Installation

1. Install [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Intall gnu stow 
```sh
sudo pacman -S stow
```
4. Backup your .config if you can cause the files in my .config will replace yours
5. Run the following command to install the dotfiles
```sh
stow .
```
6. Enjoy!

I think that should be enough.
